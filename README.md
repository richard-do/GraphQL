# GraphQL

GraphQL allows developers to query entities and pick out specific properties they wish to return.

To run, simply run the application as a spring boot application.  After that use a program such as postman or insomnia that can make queries to localhost:8080/students

Individual students can be placed with POST, list of students with PUT, and query with GET mappings.

See https://graphql.org/ to understand the structure of the queries.

School project where we were given freedom to pick anything that can be utilized with Spring Boot and create an application using it.
